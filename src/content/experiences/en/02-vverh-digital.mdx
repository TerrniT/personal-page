**Team (including me)**: 1 Frontend, 1 Backend, 1 QA, 1 PM
**Process**: Lightweight Easy-Agile (no retrospectives). Tasks tracked in Notion and Excel.

### Project

**ERP / CRM system for an engineering & design company (Avalon, avln.ru)** — a leading regional engineering firm delivering design and BIM-based digital modeling for large real estate developers.

### Description

Designed and developed a corporate SPA from scratch to automate key business processes of an engineering company.
The system includes project management (with BIM models), HR management, vacation planning, and document workflow within a single interface, replacing fragmented Excel files and legacy tools.

The solution became a centralized digital hub used by **400+ specialists**, directly improving operational efficiency and project transparency.

**Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Vue 3 (Composition API), WebSocket, Storybook, Quasar Framework, Pinia, Naive UI, Tailwind CSS, Docker, ESLint

### Responsibilities

* Led the full system lifecycle from business process analysis (BIM project management, vacation planning, document flow) to frontend architecture and implementation.
* Designed and maintained a custom **design system (UI Kit)** with **100+ reusable components**, based on Naive UI and custom Tailwind CSS components.
* Introduced and maintained **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** architecture, forming a scalable and maintainable codebase with **20+ functional modules**.
* Developed HR planning and task management modules, including **high-performance custom Gantt charts** for visualizing vacations and project stages, optimized for interactivity and large datasets.

### Achievements

* Built a private **headless UI npm package** for a custom Gantt chart component, saving the client approximately **€700/year** by replacing third-party solutions.
* Automated CI/CD and developer workflow (CI pipelines, pre-commit hooks, Commitizen), eliminating critical errors in the main branch and ensuring stable deployments.

Developed and maintained a commercial SPA calculator embedded as an iframe widget into a Bitrix-based website.
The system calculated prices for complex constructions across **150+ product variations** and automatically generated technical-commercial proposals.

**Tech Stack**: JavaScript, Sass, Vue 2.7, Nuxt 2, Vuetify 2, Bitrix

### Responsibilities

* Implemented a document workflow module for generating and exporting commercial proposals in multiple formats with print-ready layouts.

### Achievements

* Refactored reactive calculation chains, eliminating critical pricing bugs.
* Implemented a **print-ready mode** for commercial proposals, removing UI elements, adapting layouts for physical printing, and controlling output via the Print API.
* Improved configurator performance by introducing lazy rendering and memoized calculations, reducing UI response time by **~40%**.
