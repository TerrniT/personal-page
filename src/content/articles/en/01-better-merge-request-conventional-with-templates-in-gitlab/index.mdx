Merge requests (MRs) play a crucial role in the collaborative software development process, allowing developers to propose changes, receive feedback, and ultimately integrate their code into a codebase. A well-structured informative merge request description can significantly enhance the efficiency of the code review process and improve overall code quality.

Gitlab, a popular used platform for version control and collaboration, provides the ability to create templates for merge request descriptions, streamlining the process, and ensuring consistent communication. In this article, we’ll explore the importance of merge request descriptions, the benefits of using templates, and how to simplify the merge request description template in Gitlab.

## What Are Merge Request Templates

The Merge Request templates are pre-defined layouts for use when creating a merge request within GitLab.
If you have them set up in your project repository, then they are available during the merge request process for selection to use.

## The Importance of Clear Descriptions

Merge request descriptions are more than just a summary of the changes being proposed. They serve as a means of communication between developers, reviewers, and stakeholders. A well-written merge request description provides essential context, explains the purpose of the changes, outlines any potential issues, and offers guidance on how to review the code effectively. Additionally, a detailed merge request description can help maintain a historical record of why specific changes were made, aiding future developers in understanding the evolution of the codebase.

## Why's of using Merge Request Templates

1.  **Consistency:** Templates ensure that all merge requests follow a consistent structure, consistency simplifies the review process, as reviewers know where to find relevant information and what to expect in terms of formatting.
2.  **Time Savings:** With a predefined template, developers spend less time figuring out what to include in the merge request description. This leads to quicker reviews and faster integration of changes.
3.  **Clarity**: Templates encourage developers to provide the necessary information in a clear and organized manner. This clarity helps reviewers understand the purpose of the changes and minimizes misunderstandings.
4.  **Documentation:** A well-designed template can serve as documentation for code changes, and provides a written record of the intentions behind the changes, making it easier for future contributors to understand and maintain the code.

## Merge Request Description Guidance

When creating a merge request description template in Gitlab, simplicity and relevance are good practices. A concise and effective template should include the following sections:


### Title

The title of the merge request should be descriptive and concise, summarizing the purpose of the changes. It should give reviewers a clear idea of what the merge request addresses.

### Description

The main body of the description should provide context for the changes. It should answer questions like:

*   What problem does this merge request solve?
*   Why are these changes necessary?
*   Are there any alternative approaches that were considered?


### Changes Made

Outline the specific changes made in this merge request. This section can include bullet points, code snippets, or screenshots to illustrate the modifications.

### Related Issues

If the merge request is related to any specific issues or feature requests, provide links to those issues. This establishes a clear connection between the code changes and the project’s overall goals.

### Additional Notes

This is an optional section where you can include any extra information that might be relevant. For instance, if certain parts of the codebase are impacted by these changes, you can mention them here.


## Creating the Template in GitLab
----------------------------------

### Create Markdown File

Start by creating a Markdown file that will serve as your merge request description template. You can use any text editor to create the file under **_.gitlab/merge\_request\_templates_** inside your project directory_._

This is sample templates:

**.gitlab\_merge\_request\_templates/Default.md**
```md
### Description  
This merge request addresses, and describe the problem or user story being addressed.  
  
### Changes Made  
Provide code snippets or screenshots as needed.  
  
### Related Issues  
Provide links to the related issues or feature requests.  
  
### Additional Notes  
Include any extra information or considerations for reviewers, such as impacted areas of the codebase.  
  
### Merge Request Checklists  
- [ ] Code follows project coding guidelines.  
- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes made.  
- [ ] I have already covered the unit testing.

```

**.gitlab\_merge\_request\_templates/Release.md**

```md
### Description  
This merge request addresses, and describe the problem or user story being addressed.  
  
### Release Document  
Provide a link to the release document.  
  
### Additional Notes  
Include any extra information or considerations for reviewers, such as impacted areas of the codebase.  
  
### Merge Request Checklists  
- [ ] Code follows project coding guidelines.  
- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes made.  
- [ ] I have already covered the unit testing.  
- [ ] Verify that the release changes have passed by QA.
```

**.gitlab\_merge\_request\_templates/Hotfix.md**

```md
### Issue  
Provide a link to the original issue or bug report.  
  
### Problem  
Describe the critical issue or bug being addressed.  
  
### Solution  
Explain the fix or solution implemented.  
  
### Changes Made  
Provide code snippets or screenshots as needed.  
  
### Additional Notes  
Include any extra information or considerations for reviewers, such as impacted areas of the codebase.  
  
### Merge Request Checklists  
- [ ] Code follows project coding guidelines.  
- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes made.  
- [ ] No new issues introduced.  
- [ ] Tested and approved by QA.
```

### Upload the Template
-------------------

Add and commit the Markdown file to your Git repository. You can do this through your preferred Git client or command line interface. For example:

```bash
git add .  
git commit -m "Add merge request description templates"  
git push origin master
```

### Test Your Template
------------------

To test whether your template works as expected or not, create a new merge request in your project. You should see the template sections populated with the content you defined when you start writing the merge request description.

### Conclusion
------------------

Simplifying the merge request description template in Gitlab can significantly enhance the efficiency of the code review process and improve collaboration among developers. By providing consistent and relevant information, you empower reviewers to provide meaningful feedback and make informed decisions about integrating changes. Remember that while templates provide a helpful structure, each merge request’s description should still be tailored to the specific context of the changes being proposed. With well-organized and informative merge request descriptions, your development team can work more effectively and produce high-quality code.
