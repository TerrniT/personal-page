Hallo, Gleb Kotovsky is here

This post will not be a guide on Elysia; for that, I’ll dedicate a separate post and publish an article soon.

For now, I’ll share how a small pet project called the Deep Question Generator came about after I tried to poke around with Elysia JS


## Brief

In simple terms, this app generates deep questions designed to enhance the quality of communication between people. Each question offers an opportunity to understand the conversation partner better, uncover their values, interests, and emotional perceptions of the world. The app aims to create more meaningful and memorable conversations.


## The Need for Deeper Conversations

I believe most people had at least one moment in their lives when they really had nothing to talk about. Or, more prosaically, moments when there is something to discuss, but the questions are all superficial. If we take the questions from this app, we can find a range of more or less simple questions like:
- "What's your favorite fruit and why?"
- "How would your friends describe you?"

And you can also encounter philosophical questions, for example:
- "How do you imagine your life after death?"
- "What's your biggest insecurites?"

Whether to answer these questions or not is up to the participants in the conversation. The main intent is to get to know each other better and possibly overcome the barriers or tension that were present at the beginning of the talk.

If you have a loved one, friends, or just acquaintances with whom you can gather and try this experiment, then I think you will enjoy this app.

## Conclusion
> Take care of your mental health, communicate on deep topics and love people
