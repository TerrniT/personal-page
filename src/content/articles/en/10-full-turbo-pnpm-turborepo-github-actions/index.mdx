# Full Turbo = PNPM + Turborepo + GitHub Actions  
This note will be useful for those who use PNPM + Turborepo on GitHub Actions.
Thanks to this action I managed to speed up the build several times â€œ FULL TURBO.   
I attach an example below   

### Example   
```yaml
  jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup turborepo cache
        uses: dtinth/setup-github-actions-caching-for-turbo@v1

      - name: Install pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
        with:
          version: 8

      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: pnpm

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Build apps
        run: pnpm build

```
