A mapped type in TypeScript is a new type created from a base type using a custom type mapping utility.

   
Creating new types using a custom type mapper is a common practice that promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles in a TypeScript codebase. There are various methods for deriving new types in TypeScript, and custom mapping is one of them.   
A TypeScript type mapper leverages the index signature syntax to transform a union type and generate a new type.   
   
### Example of a Mapped Type   
Let's say you have an interface representing user profile:   
```
interface User {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    email: string;
}

```
Now, if you want to create a new type where all the properties of the `User` interface are optional, you can use a mapped type like this:   
```
type Partial<T> = {
    [K in keyof T]?: T[K];
};

type OptionalUser = Partial<User>;

```
   
Partial Type was added to the utility types since [2.1](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-1.html#partial-readonly-record-and-pick) typescript version   
### Explanation:   
1. **User Interface**: Defines the structure of a user with `id`, `name`, and `email`.   
2. **Mapped Type**: `Partial<T>` takes a type `T` and creates a new type where all properties of `T` are optional. Here:   
    - `K in keyof T` iterates over each key of `T`.   
    - `T[K]` gets the type of each property, and the `?` makes them optional.   
3. **OptionalUser Type**: `OptionalUser` is now a new type based on `User` where all the properties (`id`, `name`, `email`) are optional.   
   
### Usage:   
You can use the `OptionalUser` type like this:   
```
const user1: OptionalUser = {}; // Valid, all properties are optional
const user2: OptionalUser = { name: "Alice" }; // Also valid
const user3: OptionalUser = { id: 1, email: "alice@example.com" }; // Valid too

```
