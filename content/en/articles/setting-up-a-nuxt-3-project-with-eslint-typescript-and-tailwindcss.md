## Introduction

Nuxt.js is a robust and versatile framework that is primarily used for building server-rendered applications with Vue.js. In this comprehensive guide, we're going to delve into the process of setting up a Nuxt 3 project template. This template will be integrated with ESLint, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. These tools, when combined, can significantly enhance productivity, enforce a high standard of code quality, and streamline the process of styling.

## Pre-requisites

- Node (In this example I used the 20.10.0 version, but any older version can work. )
- Npm (tested with v7)
- Pnpm (but you can use just npm / yarn)

## Setting Up Nuxt 3

Nuxt 3 is the latest iteration of the Nuxt.js framework. It comes with a host of significant improvements and innovative features that make the process of Vue.js development more efficient and enjoyable. The setup process for a new project with Nuxt 3 is straightforward.

Firstly, you'll need to install Node.js and npm. These are fundamental to running the Nuxt 3 framework. Once you have these installed, you can create a new Nuxt 3 project using the `nuxi@latest` command. This command initiates a process that will guide you through the various setup stages, allowing you to customize your project according to your specific needs. In this guide I will use pnpm as package manager. So let‚Äôs init our project:

```bash
pnpm dlx nuxi@latest init nuxt3-template
cd nuxt3-template
pnpm i && pnpm run dev
```

## First result

After initiation we get a template project on nuxt 3. So let's make it even better

## Integrating ESLint and TypeScript

ESLint is a widely recognized tool that identifies and reports on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. The integration of ESLint can drastically improve the quality of your code, and helps to prevent potential bugs from cropping up in the future.

On the other hand, TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types. It's an invaluable tool that helps to detect errors early during the development phase, thus saving time and resources.

To add these to your Nuxt project, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies and then implement the appropriate configurations in your project's settings. With the ESLint and TypeScript integrations, your development environment becomes more robust by enforcing good coding practices and type safety

```bash
# Add eslint module and typescript to nuxt project
pnpm install -D eslint eslint-plugin-vue@latest 

pnpm add -D @nuxtjs/eslint-module

pnpm install -D typescript @typescript-eslint/parser@latest @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@latest
```

Update `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```tsx
// nuxt.config.ts

export default defineNuxtConfig({
	devtools: { enabled: false },
	modules: [
	  '@nuxtjs/eslint-module'
	]
})
```

Create `.eslintrc.cjs` file and add these lines of code:

```jsx
// .eslintrc.cjs

module.exports = {
	root: true,
	parser: "vue-eslint-parser",
	parserOptions: {
	  parser: {
			ts: "@typescript-eslint/parser"
	  }
	},
	env: {
	  node: true,
	  browser: true
	},
	extends: [
	  "plugin:vue/vue3-recommended"
	],
	rules: {
	  "no-trailing-spaces": ["warn"],
	  "prefer-promise-reject-errors": "off",
	  "vue/no-v-html": "off",
	  "no-trailing-spaces": ["warn"],
	  "no-debugger": process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "error" : "off",
	  "vue/multi-word-component-names": ["error", {
			ignores: ["error", "Error"]
	  }]
	},
	ignorePatterns: ['dist', 'node_modules', 'build', 'coverage', 'docs', 'test'],
	overrides: [
	  {
			files: ["components/**/**/*.vue"],
			rules: { "vue/multi-word-component-names": "off" }
	  }
	]
}

```

If eslint doesn‚Äôt work the first time, you will need to delete `node_modules` and install the project again. 

After these steps, the project will already have a configured eslint, which also acts as a formatter

## Incorporating Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that offers an unprecedented level of customization. It allows developers to build responsive designs with relative ease. To include Tailwind CSS in your Nuxt project, you need to install it as a project dependency.

Once installed, you should create a Tailwind config file. This file is crucial as it allows you to customize your design according to your project's needs. Following this, you need to update your Nuxt config file to include Tailwind CSS in your project's build step.

One of the main advantages of Tailwind CSS is that you can write custom styles directly in your HTML. This reduces the need for separate CSS files and makes your styles easier to manage and maintain

Let‚Äôs init tailwind css config file:

```bash
pnpm install -D postcss autoprefixer
pnpm dlx tailwindcss init
pnpm add --save-dev @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
```

Our tailwind.config.js file should look like this:

```jsx
// tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
		"./components/**/*.{js,vue,ts}",
		"./layouts/**/*.vue",
		"./pages/**/*.vue",
		"./plugins/**/*.{js,ts}",
		"./app.vue",
		"./error.vue",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

```

And update `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```jsx
// nuxt.config.ts
// https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config
export default defineNuxtConfig({
	devtools: { enabled: false },
	modules: [
		"@nuxtjs/eslint-module",
		// add tailwindcss module
		'@nuxtjs/tailwindcss'
	],
	// add postcss support for tailwindcss
	postcss: {
		plugins: {
		  tailwindcss: {},
		  autoprefixer: {},
		}
	}
})
```

You should also remember to create a root file for tailwindcss

```bash
// in project root
mkdir assets/
cd assets
mkdir css/
cd css
touch tailwind.css
```

```css
/* tailwind.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

If you want to see if tailwindcss works just copy this template and add it to `app.vue`

```html
<!-- app.vue -->
<template>
  <div class="flex flex-col w-full h-screen bg-zinc-950 items-center justify-center">
    <div class="mx-auto">
      <h1 class="text-3xl text-blue-400 font-bold underline">
        Nuxt 3 template
      </h1>
      <ul class="text-white flex flex-col gap-y-3 mt-6 ">
        <li class="hover:text-blue-950">
          <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>
        </li>
        <li class="hover:text-blue-950">
          <a href="https://eslint.org/">Eslint</a>
        </li>
        <li class="hover:text-blue-950">
          <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

```

## Conclusion
